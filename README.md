For many Sails apps, Passport is overkill- it's quite easy to set up local authentication yourself using only `req.session`.

But in scenarios where you're doing authentication across multiple providers, Passport can make sense, and save you a lot of time.

<!-- This tutorial takes advantage of a quick passport hook I put together to eliminate some of the more confusing aspects of integration with Sails from user-space.  For an in-depth tutorial on how the hook ended up getting built, check out [ORIGINAL_PREHOOK_WALKTHROUGH.md](https://github.com/sails101/using-passport/blob/master/ORIGINAL_2014_WALKTHROUGH.md). -->
